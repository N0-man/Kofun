# Kofun

This repo is to play with various Functional Programming concepts using Kotlin as langauge. Will use either native langauge features or external library to make the code more fluent, reduce ceremonies / sugar and less imperative as possible

BTW in real world, Kofun (Âè§Â¢≥, from Sino-Japanese "ancient grave") are megalithic tombs or tumuli in Northeast Asia üòâ but will stick to [Ko] Kotlin and [Fun] Functional Programming in this repo...

## Concepts

1. First-class functions
2. Recursion
3. Immutability
4. Pure functions
5. High order functions

Ideas

- Functional Data Structure
- Strictness and Laziness
- Purely functional state
- Purely functional parallelism
- Monoids and Functions
